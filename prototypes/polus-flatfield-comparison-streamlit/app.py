    The image dataset used in this project includes a collection of images provided by Axle's Polus AI team. To correct these images, the Polus AI WIPP plugins for Flat-Field Corrections were used, including the estimation and apply plugins. The raw images were processed, resulting in corrected images that were stored in a designated output folder to be used in this app.

    The Polus Flatfield Comparison App was developed to showcase the effectiveness of the correction process on the images. This app utilizes the Streamlit Image Comparison component from the streamlit_image_comparison library. It enables side-by-side comparison and visualization of two images, allowing users to easily observe differences and analyze the impact of the correction.

    By showcasing the correction performed by the Polus AI WIPP plugins with the Streamlit Image Comparison component, this project provides a tool for evaluating and understanding the effects of flat field correction on the image dataset.
