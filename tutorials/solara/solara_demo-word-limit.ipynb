    "[Solara](https://solara.dev/) is an open-source library that makes it easy to build web apps from pure Python using ipywidgets and a React-likle API. Solara offers the ability to build large, complex apps while keeping code simple. See quickstart instructions [here](https://solara.dev/docs/quickstart). Solara apps work both inside Jupyter Notebooks and as a standalone web app.\n",

    "If you are using a built-in module such as `python-data-science-0.1.8`, please install the `solara` package inside a Jupyter cell. If you are using your own Python environment created inside Notebooks Hub (see instructions [here](https://polusai.github.io/notebooks-hub/user/environments.html#creating-a-new-user-environment)), `solara` can be installed directly inside your environment using the terminal.\n",
